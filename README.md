  ## Overview of the Project

This project focuses on analyzing financial data to create dashboards that provide detailed insights into customer consumption habits within the banking sector. The analysis aims to uncover a variety of trends and correlations to inform strategic decisions and improve service offerings.

Key areas of investigation include:

1. **Gender-specific Credit Card Usage:** Analyzing trends to understand differences in credit card usage patterns between genders. This includes examining the frequency of transactions, average transaction amounts, and preferred spending categories.

2. **Impact of Marital Status on Financial Behavior:** Investigating how marital status influences credit consumption patterns and financial decisions. This analysis will explore whether there are notable differences in spending behavior between married, single, and other marital status categories.

3. **Most Utilized Categories of Bank Cards:** Identifying which categories of bank cards (e.g., debit, credit, prepaid) are most frequently used by customers. This analysis will help prioritize service improvements and marketing strategies tailored to customer preferences.
